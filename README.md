## This project was developed to demonstrate how Gemini AI can be used in the development of web applications and mobile applications. 
### For the web applications can be used by any default browser and for the mobile application, there is an APK available in the repository.

## How to run the web application version on your computer
1. Download the repository
2. Open the main directory folder in which IDE of your choice (Visual Studio Code for example)
3. From the terminal in Visual Studio Code execute the command 
```
python main.py

```
4. You will notice that two private IP numbers are displayed in the terminal. Click on any of them and a new window will open in your web browser.

5. Enter your question or comment in the space provided. Click where it says "Ask to AI" and wait for the response from the Gemini model. As simple as that. For example, in our case we input the prompt text: *When humans will live on Mars or Jupiter?* and check the answer below that we got from the AI.
