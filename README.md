## This project was developed to demonstrate how Gemini AI can be used in the development of a Chatbot available to create a web application. 
### We also managed to integrate the Gemini AI model to create an application in Flutter and be able to use Chatbots on a smart device that uses Android.

## How to run the web application version on your computer
1. Download the repository
2. Open the main directory folder in which IDE of your choice (Visual Studio Code for example)
3. From the terminal in Visual Studio Code execute the command 
```
python main.py

```
4. You will notice that two private IP numbers are displayed in the terminal. Click on any of them and a new window will open in your web browser.
5. Enter your question or comment in the space provided. Click where it says "Ask to AI" and wait for the response from the Gemini model. As simple as that.
